# STRATEGY MODULE
## Implementation of live simulation
We need to implement a mechanism to simulate the trading in a live environment.

## Lack of slippage and fees consideration:
The strategy doesn't account for slippage or trading fees, which could significantly impact real-world performance.

## Partial closes are not handled correctly
The adjust_entry_price method is called after partial closes, but it doesn't take into account the possibility of multiple partial closes. It might need to be more sophisticated for complex trading scenarios.

## No clear implementation of stop loss and take profit
We need to implement a clear mechanism to set and adjust stop loss and take profit levels based on the strategy's requirements.

## No clear implementation of position sizing
We need to implement a clear mechanism to size positions based on the strategy's requirements and risk management rules.

## No clear implementation of entry price
We need to implement a clear mechanism to set and adjust entry price based on the strategy's requirements.

## No clear implementation of trailing stop
We need to implement a clear mechanism to set and adjust trailing stop levels based on the strategy's requirements.

# TRADING MODULE
## Actual ordering and closing
Long, short orders needs to be implemented. Close and partial close orders needs to be implemented.

# MONITORING MODULE
## Unified dashboard
We need to implement a unified dashboard to monitor all strategies and positions.

## Strategy performance
We need to implement a mechanism to monitor the performance of all strategies.

## Position monitoring
We need to implement a mechanism to monitor all positions.

## Account monitoring
We need to implement a mechanism to monitor the account balance, profit, loss, risk, reward, leverage, margin, margin call, stop out, and liquidation.

## Order monitoring
We need to implement a mechanism to monitor all orders.

# AI MODULE with openai
## Anomaly detection
We need to implement a mechanism to detect anomalies in the trading data.

## Strategy selection
We need to implement a mechanism to select the best strategy based on the market conditions.

## Strategy parameters optimization
We need to implement a mechanism to optimize the parameters of all strategies.

## Strategy performance analysis
We need to implement a mechanism to analyze the performance of all strategies.

## Dynamic risk management
We need to implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the risk management rules based on the market conditions.
